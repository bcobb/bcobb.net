Hello, my name is <a href="/about.html">Michael R. Bernstein</a> and this is my personal blog. The posts are divided into sections below, because that is how I tend to write - for a period about one subject at a time.
<br/>

<br/>
<h1>Talks and Presentations</h1>
<div class="lead">I try to follow up talks and presentations I give with posts with materials and an overview. Here are the posts I've managed to write so far.</div>
<ul class = "posts">
{% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.published and post.talks %}
    <li class="index">
      <div class="index-date">{{ post.date | date: "%Y.%m.%d" }}</div><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h1>Distraction Accrection</h1>
<div class="lead">I don't know what to expect in terms of what will show up here, but I know I need this section.</div>
<ul class = "posts">
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% if post.published and post.other %}
    <li class="index">
      <div class="index-date">{{ post.date | date: "%Y.%m.%d" }}</div><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h1>Concepts, Techniques, and Models</h1>
<div class="lead">I am working my way through <a href="http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html">Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming</a> and writing about as much of it as I can. These posts are my take on a very dense and rewarding book.</div>
<ul class = "posts">
{% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.published and post.ctm %}
    <li class="index">
      <div class="index-date">{{ post.date | date: "%Y.%m.%d" }}</div><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h1>Computing Without Computers</h1>
<div class="lead">The more I learn about computers, the more I look elsewhere to help me understand them. This series of posts is an experiment in getting away from the screen.</div>
<ul class = "posts">
{% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.published and post.cwc %}
    <li class="index">
      <div class="index-date">{{ post.date | date: "%Y.%m.%d" }}</div><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h1>Distributed Systems Archaeology</h1>
<div class="lead">I gave a talk at <a href="http://ricon.io/west.html">Ricon West</a> in October 2013 called "Distributed Systems Archaeology." This section contains one article written during research, and the available resources documenting the talk, including a written transcript.</div>
<ul class = "posts">
{% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.published and post.dsa %}
    <li class="index">
      <div class="index-date">{{ post.date | date: "%Y.%m.%d" }}</div><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h1>Garbage Collection</h1>
<div class="lead">I tend to get obsessed with topics and get into them deeply. In preparation for <a href="http://michaelrbernste.in/2013/06/10/to-know-a-garbage-collector-goruco-2013.html">a talk</a>, I worked on a series of posts about the very broad subject of Garbage Collection.</div>
<ul class = "posts">
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% if post.published and post.gc %}
    <li class="index">
      <div class="index-date">{{ post.date | date: "%Y.%m.%d" }}</div><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>
