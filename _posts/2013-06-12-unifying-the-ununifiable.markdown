### Unifying The Ununifiable: The Duality Of GC Algorithms

Garbage Collection is typically understood in a way which creates a tension between two families of algorithms  known as *reference counting* and *tracing.* The authors of *A Unified Theory of Garbage Collection*, published in 2004, created a framework for understanding these algorithms which blew the top off of the notion that the algorithms are fundamentally different.
