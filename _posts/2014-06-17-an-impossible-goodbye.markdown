### I'll never stop calling it 'The City'

I don't have a habit of posting anything personal on this blog, but there's room here for anything.

I also don't have really have the words to express how this makes me feel to say, but here it goes: On August 1st, 2014, my family and I are moving out of New York City to pursue a new life in the Washington, D.C. area.

There are many factors that make this the right choice for us right now, and equally as many that make it a gut-wrenching, impossible goodbye.

Really, I'm not going to try and write down what it's like to leave before I leave.

For my local friends, we still have plenty of time together, and I'll be back in "the city" often.

Also, I'll never stop calling it "The City."

See you all soon.
