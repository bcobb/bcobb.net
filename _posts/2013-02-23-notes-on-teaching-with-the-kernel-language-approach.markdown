## Notes on "Teaching Programming with the Kernel Language Approach"

These are some notes on a paper, <a href="http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/people/PVR/fdpefinalweb.pdf">Teaching Programming with the Kernel Language Approach" (PDF)</a> outlining the teaching techniques used in _Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming_ by Van Roy and Haridi, which I am <a href="http://michaelrbernste.in/2013/02/19/CTM-chapter-01.html">currently studying</a>. As a former Computer Science educator I am intrigued by the approach that the book takes, and as a Functional Programming and Computer Science History fan I am intrigued by how it positions itself as an improvement on the techniques in _The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_. Browsing around on the book's <a href="http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html">rather dense web site</a>, I found a link to this paper, which seemed to provide an interesting link between the book and the classroom. Here's a bit from the abstract:

>"We present the kernel language approach, a new way to teach programming that situates most of the widely-known programming paradigms (including imperative, object-oriented, concurrent, logic, and functional) in a uniform setting that shows their deep relationships and how to use them together. Widely-different practical languages (exemplified by Java, Haskell, Prolog, and Erlang) with their rich panoplies of abstractions and syntax are explained by straightforward translations into closely-related kernel languages, simple languages that consist of small numbers of programmer-significant concepts."

The following diagram covers the "steps in the kernel language approach," and describes how the approach can be used to describe programming paradigms from the simplest to the most complex:

I couldn't help but note thta my industry is entirely based on the most complex parts of this diagram, and that many of its practitioners jump straight into that without ever having even been exposed to the idea of the continuum that the above diagram represents.

## Notes and Quotes

* "For the purposes of this paper, let us consider a broad definition of computer programming as bridging the gap between specification and running program."
* "Teaching programming in terms of a single paradigm or language has a detrimental effect on programmer competence and thus on program quality."
* Programming is taught in three different ways:
  * As a Craft
  * As a Branch of Mathematics
  * In Terms of Concepts
