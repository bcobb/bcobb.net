### Distributed Systems Archaeology: Works Cited

I have received many requests for a list of papers and books from my [Ricon talk]("https://speakerdeck.com/mrb/distributed-systems-archaeology") with links for downloading where applicable. In all but two cases, these works are freely available. The two which aren't are newer, commercially available books which I encourage you to pursue and purchase if possible.

Please note that for brevity, these works are listed by their primary authors but in many cases there were other authors involved. Additionally, many of the links below are direct downloads, please be prepared for that fact.

Where possible I have linked to the author's publication pages.
