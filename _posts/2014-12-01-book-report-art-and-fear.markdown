I can't remember who recommended I read _[Art &amp; Fear]_ (by David Bayles and Ted Orland), but [Sam](https://twitter.com/sabramse) bought it for me for my birthday last year, and I finally sat down to read it[^1].
From the start, I was struck by how much the authors' perspective on artmaking could just as easily apply to programming.
Below are a dozen or so quotations pulled from the book that seem particularly relevant.
I think they stand on their own without context, but the whole story is well-worth the price of the book.

- "Making the work you want to make means finding nourishment within the work itself" (p. 2)
- "[We assume that] Artmaking involves skills that can be learned" (p. 3)
- "To all viewers but yourself, what matters is the product...To you, and you alone, what matters is the process" (p. 5)
- "equating art with 'self-expression' reveals more a contemporary bias in our thinking than an underlying trait of the medium" (p. 7)
- "those who continue to make art are those who...have learned how not to quit"[^2] (p. 9)
- "vision is always ahead of execution---and it _should_ be" (p. 15)
- "the artist's life is frustrating not because the passage is slow, but because [they imagine] it to be fast" (p. 17)
- "[Artists] get better by learning to work, and by learning _from_ their work" (p. 28)
- "Your work tells you about your working methods, your discipline, your strengths and weaknesses, you habitual gestures, your willingness to embrace" (p. 36)
- "On both intellectual and technical grounds, it's wise to remain on good terms with your artistic heritage, lest you devote several incarnations to re-inventing the wheel" (p. 44)
- "When things go haywire, your best operating strategy might be to return...to the habits and practices in play the last time you felt good about the work" (p. 57)
- "certain tools make certain results possible"[^3] (p. 58)
- "The dilemma facing academia is that it must accommodate not only students who are striving to become artists, but also teachers who are struggling to remain artists" (p. 80)
- "your job as an artist is to push craft to its limits---without being trapped by it" (p. 99)
- "In making art you declare what is important" (p. 108)

I will say: I'm not comfortable drawing terribly stark lines between programming and art.
For most programmers, the purpose of making a program is to accomplish something unrelated to the program itself.
A finished program[^4] _feels_ more utilitarian than a finished work of art.
And yet, the internal design of a program and its utility are intertwined, particularly with regard to _future_ utility (agility?).
Certainly, the internal design is a subject of great interest and frequent debate to those who work on the program, down to the lowest level of abstraction[^5].

Then there's the related matter of aesthetics[^6], which then veers into taxonomy/folksonomy/ontology territory, since identifiers lend to the aesthetic and are notoriously difficult to choose.
The conversations around aesthetics and design often feel like conversations about art, even though the end-result is purportedly what really matters.
This is to say, programming seems to be both an act of expression and an act of producing something useful, and I think there's a tension between the two.
Jacob Thornton ([@fat](https://twitter.com/fat)) has a [great post](http://byfat.xxx/deep-emo-shit) comparing the development of Ratchet and Twitter Bootstrap that explores this angle some more.

Waffling aside, I think there's a rich vein of ideas at the intersection of programming and art, and I intend to revisit _Art &amp; Fear_ periodically to wrestle with them.

[^1]: To really get a jumpstart on a book, head to your local laundromat and only bring a book, a notebook, and a pencil. Well---that, and some laundry.
[^2]: I _love_ the "Operation Manual For Not Quitting" which, in short, is: find a group of peers, share your in-progress work with each other, and make _that_ the true "destination" of your work.
[^3]: Strictly speaking, achieving a result in some language implies that one can achieve that result in _any_ Turing-equivalent language. Still, I think that this _sentiment_ (something-something linguistic relativity) holds true in programming.
[^4]: Though, what does it mean for a program to be "finished," anyway?
[^5]: It is in the design of a codebase that we "declare what is important," no?
[^6]: It's become popular to attempt to settle on an aesthetic and enforce it programmatically, but there's seemingly always minutae.
