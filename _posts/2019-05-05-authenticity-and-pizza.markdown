I really enjoyed these two posts from last year by Toby Shorin: [After Authenticity](https://subpixel.space/entries/after-authenticity/) and [The Disbeliever's Guide to Authenticity](https://subpixel.space/entries/the-disbelievers-guide-to-authenticity/).

I'm not really equipped to riff on his work, but I do have an anecdote about a quest for authenticity coming full circle.

As a kid, my mom made pizza from scratch with some regularity, at least once a month in my memory.
Her method was to make a basic, quick-rising dough, then divide, stretch, proof, and bake it in a couple of quarter sheet pans.
Today, I would call it [grandma pizza](https://www.bonappetit.com/restaurants-travel/article/find-grandma-pie) but at the time I don't remember it having a special name.
[Rocky Rococo](https://rockyrococo.com/) and Pizza Hut's personal pan pizza were the closest approximations out in the world.

In college, my friend Jamie got me interested in making pizzas.
He and I started with store-bought crust, but we eventually started making our own dough and quickly focused our efforts on approximating Neapolitan-style pizza, which seemed like the most authentic pizza one could make.

Learning how to make Neapolitan pizza is like catnip for an authenticity-seeker.
There's [a whole association](https://www.pizzanapoletana.org/en/chi_siamo) dedicated to "promoting and protecting the true Neapolitan pizza" down to stipulating that _true_ Neapolitan pizza dough cannot contain olive oil.
And in the Midwest in 2008, Neapolitan pizza was rare, or at least it _seemed_ rare.

There's a special and irritating kind of self-satisfaction only available in pursuits where authenticity is both prized and rare.

So we bought 00 flour, San Marzano tomatoes, a pizza stone, and a pizza peel.
We did not use olive oil in our dough.
As a now-enlightened 21 year-old, I looked at my childhood pizza as a tasty, but ultimately _inauthentic_ relative of the pies Jamie and I made.
Not that we ever got all that close to a truly authentic result.
There's only so much you can do in a college apartment, without a wood-burning oven.

After college, I continued to seek out and occasionally make Neapolitan-style pizza.
I upgraded my stone to a [Baking Steel](https://www.bakingsteel.com/), which I highly recommend.
The pinnacle, in my mind, was the San Francisco outpost of Una Pizza Napoletana: essentially a one-man show dedicated to perfecting the craft and the discipline of making pizza in a wood-fired oven.
I still think the Filetti I had there is the best pizza I've ever had.

Time passed and I started making pizzas more regularly with my friend Patrick.
He got me into cast-iron skillet pizza, which I remember seeing mentioned more frequently online.
Adam Kuban started doing bar pizza at [Margot's](https://margotspizza.com/).
I developed a fondness for [Imo's](https://www.imospizza.com/).
Slice had been talking about this stuff for years, but I missed it.

When I finally learned about the Sicilian slice and the grandma slice I had an epiphany: my mom is half-Sicilian, so I _had_ been having authentic pizza all along.

Except, my mom's pizza dough recipe wasn't handed down to her from her immigrant grandmother.
She got it from a magazine in Tucson, AZ circa 1992.
My great-grandma baked bread every day into her 90s, but I honestly don't know if she ever made a pizza.

My desire to find and make what-I-thought-was-authentic pizza led me to develop an interest in baking, and to try a lot of delicious food.
It brought me closer to my mom.
On occasion, it led me to pay premium prices for utterly mediocre food that _just so happened_ to use a handful of blessed ingredients and equipment, which I almost certainly ate thinking, "this is good, actually".

Authenticity doesn't have flavor or texture, and it's not a reliable proxy for whether something is True and Good.
My mom's basil pesto and feta pie is extraordinary.
Is it authentic?
I don't know.
That's not really what I'm looking for anymore.
