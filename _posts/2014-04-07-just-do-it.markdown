### Just Do It

People often ask me where my obsession with reading started. I can say without hesitation that it comes from the unparalleled quantity of pestering that I received from my parents, specifically my father. While many parents shared the common love of a sports team with their children, hanging the posters of the baseball or football team in their rooms, my father, one day, did his own version of this.

It was 1992, and I was 12 years old. I was resting during the day in my room when my dad knocked on the door. He had in his hands a freshly printed, accordian folded pile of dot matrix paper. I groaned, recognizing it as something lame he had printed in PrintShop that he wanted to hang on my wall. It was just that. He unfurled the poster, which read, simply:

> "Just Do It"

Not as in, *achieve your sports goal* or *become president of the United States*, but just generally, *Just Do It*, specifically, every time you don't want to keep reading, look up at this sign, and remember to: 

> "Just Do It"

A pretty simple message, but hey - it worked.
