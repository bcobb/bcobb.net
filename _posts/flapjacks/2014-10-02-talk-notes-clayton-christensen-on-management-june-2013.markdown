I watched another [Instapapered talk][1] this morning, this one via [Ryan Singer][2]. After watching, I suspect he shared it because of the extended summary of the [Jobs to be Done][3] framework midway through.

Clayton starts off recounting an anecdote from evolutionary biology about the “Panda’s Thumb” — a biological feature that was required at one point in history, but is no longer needed. Pandas have rigid thumbs because they no longer need them! His thesis is that there are Panda’s Thumbs in companies. That is, there are processes and conventions that only exist in the present day because they existed yesterday and nobody’s yet asked “do we still need to be doing this?” or “do we still need to be doing this in this particular way?”

I love this idea. What are our Panda’s Thumbs?

He surmises that there are a lot of important decisions in companies that were never made explicitly by the management, and we just keep following those decisions today. One example of this might be defining customer segments. Perhaps a company segmented its customers by age some time ago, and that segmentation is now taken for granted. But is that the *best* way to think about customer segments? Maybe not. It’s important to consider, though, since these segments act as the lenses through which the company sees the world, and define what the company does and does not do.

This segues into the Jobs to be Done framework. The mindset of this framework is that *stuff* happens to people all day long, and this *stuff* causes problems, and the fundamental engine of commerce is people hiring products and services to solve their problems. The example he gives here is that McDonald’s wanted to improve milkshake sales, but the changes they made based on customer focus groups had no effect. When they instead tried to figure out what job their milkshakes were being hired to perform, they realized that the biggest consumers of milkshakes were people starting their morning commute, who wanted not only something to eat on the way, but something to keep them occupied. They then changed the milkshakes to perform that job better: more viscous, with bits of fruit and chocolate to make it more interesting to slurp through a straw.

While that’s neat, his point is understanding the customer is not as important as understanding the job that your product/service is hired to do. He claims that companies which organize around a job to be done have few-to-no competitors. His example here is IKEA, where you go when you need to furnish something quickly and cheaply, especially if you’re in an apartment (try lugging assembled furniture to your fourth-floor walkup). IKEA is organized around that one job, and it happens to do other jobs pretty well, too.

He shows this diagram of the four levels in the architecture of a job:

![Four levels in the architecture of a job][4]

As an aside, I am fascinated by The Jobs to be Done framework. I think it's a great mindset to take into helping clients with strategic thinking, and lately I’ve been mulling on how it applies to building software libraries. It’s very, very cool.

What job is FullStack hired to do? I think the answer is probably more subtle than you might think.

He closes the talk by discussing incubators and how the trajectory from an incubator can be treacherous if you end up trying to convince people who are tasked with “making numbers” to take on a ton of risk by continuing to support your fledgeling product. It was an interesting segment, but the highlight of the talk for me was definitely the JTBD bit.
