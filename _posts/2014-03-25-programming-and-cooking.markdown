### On Programming and Cooking

We should be reading fewer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">recipes</a> and more <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">food science</a>.

#### Notes

<a id="bib1">[1]</a> For an actual book on food science, check out Harold McGee's <a href="http://curiouscook.typepad.com/site/on-food-and-cooking.html">On Food and Cooking</a>. It is a fantastically effective book on how to cook because it teaches you the science and history of food -- you don't only get the how, you get the why.
