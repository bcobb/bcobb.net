My name's Brian Cobb, and I'm a programmer based in Brooklyn, NY.
I currently work for [Harry's][harrys], from the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript front-end to the Rails and Scala back-end.
Before that, I wrote Ruby and Clojure for [healthfinch][hf].

If you'd like to get in touch, send me an email.
You can find my address on my [GitHub profile][gh]
