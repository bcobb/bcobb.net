As I [tooted the other day], I read [_Art &amp; Fear_], by David Bayles and Ted Orland.
It's a great book, and I especially recommend it to folks who've held a title like "Programmer" or "Software Engineer" or "Applications Developer."
Such a person will, I think, find a surprising number of parallels between the working artist and the working programmer.
To be sure, there are distinct differences between the two[^1], and I'd like to discuss some of those differences eventually.
Still, I can't unsee the parallels.

In the very first chapter, on page 7, Bayles and Orland write:

> "Artist" has become a form of identity...[but] consider that if artist equals self, then when (inevitably) you make flawed art, you are a flawed person, and when (worse yet) you make no art, you are no person at all!

It calls to mind Sam Stephenson's post, [_You Are Not Your Code_](http://sstephenson.us/posts/you-are-not-your-code) from about two years ago.
Among the teams I've been on, the notions that "you are not your code" and that "the whole team owns the code" have been pervasive.
Programmers rely on each other to vet and critique the code they've written, from whitespace and formatting to structural design.
"The whole team owns the code" is much easier said than done, and a whole host of team and power dynamics play into whether or not a given criticism feels positive or negative.
Regardless, regular critique is a fundamental part of working on a software team; healthy teams work to minimize the amount of ego any one individual leaves in the code.

But software written solo is somehow different than software written by a dedicated team.
Reading Sam's post now, I get the sense that authoring and maintaining a popular open source library feels more like a performance than a collaboration.
(And certainly: there is an element of performance in the act of writing code&mdash;programmers often talk about "code style" or "stylistic decisions," for instance.)
But Prototype and its successors are tools, and their utility will always matter more to their consumers than any element of self-expression within.[^2]

If _Art &amp; Fear_ has anything to say about gracefully sidestepping this sort of identity crisis, it is that folks who _make stuff_ should invest their ego not in their _artifacts_ but in the _act_ of making things, and in the habits that historically have produced work.

Sam isn't a good programmer because he _wrote Prototype_[^3].
Sam is a good programmer because he _writes code_.

[^1]: For instance, on p. 87, "[M]aking art is not considered a _real_ job."
[^2]: That said, I'm fascinated by the extent to which programming can be an outlet for self-expression. [@fat](http://byfat.xxx/deep-emo-shit) has a great post on this, contrasting his work on Twitter Bootstrap to his work on Ratchet.
[^3]: Though, seriously, thanks for writing Prototype, Sam. I sure got a lot out of it.
